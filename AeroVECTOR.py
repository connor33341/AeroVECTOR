Apologies in advance for any spelling or grammar error, english is not
my first language.

known bugs-> Arrows are hit or miss, sometimes they aim in the right
direction, sometimes they don't.

########### OVERALL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PROGRAM
Non-linear model integrates local accelerations into global velocities.
An alternative method of vector derivates is still in the program,
although results are better with the first method.

No supersonic rockets!
Subsonic/Compressible Aerodynamics are very similar to Open Rocket's,
there are some differences, especially
in drag calculations (not more than 20%)

Important, all angles are in RADIANS (Standard 1ยบ*np.pi/180 = radian)

DEG2RAD = np.pi / 180
RAD2DEG = 1 / DEG2RAD

Code simulates the Actuator reduction (gear/lever ratio), it multiplies
the output of the controller times the
that reduction, and then sends that output to the servo.
Remember that you must multiply the output of the controller times the
TVC reduction in you flight computer!
All in all, the overall structure of the function "control_theta" and
"PID" should be copied in your code to
ensure that the simulator and flight computer are doing the same thing,
unless you are using SITL.
